# LOCALS
Contains dataset, models and implementation source code of LOCALS

## How to run code:
- Step 1: Make sure you have a conda pytorch gpu environment (look up setup videos on youtube). 
- Step 2: Make sure the following versions of python / python libraries are installed.
  - Python 3.10.18
  - Torch 2.5.1
  - Numpy 2.0.1
  - Matplotlib any version
  - Tqdm 4.67.1
- Step 3: Download JupyterLab on anaconda under the pytorch gpu environment you just created (assuming anaconda exists since you will have used conda to make pytorch gpu environment).
- Step 4: Download source code, necessary models and datasets needed for running (linked in *models* and *datasets* section).
- Step 5: Run code using by launching JupyterLab and pressing the run button.
